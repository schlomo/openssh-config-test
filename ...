This is a test suite for SSH PKI support.

clone this, change into the cloned directory and run run_demo.sh to find out
if your OpenSSH supports CA-based operations. Read the run_demo.sh script and look at
the *_config files to see how to use SSH PKI.

Requirements on Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install fakeroot sshpass checkinstall

Developed on Ubuntu 13.04 as an automated SSH PKI demo for my Linux Magazin article.
